<a href="https://image-crypt.netlify.app/">ImgCrypt</a> is a <b>react</b> web-based tool that empowers you to securely encrypt image files using cutting-edge hashing and the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This guarantees that only authorized users with the correct password can decrypt and view the original image. ImageCrypt has been meticulously designed to prioritize security while offering a straightforward and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Advanced Encryption:** Utilizes the AES-256 encryption algorithm, one of the most robust encryption methods available.
- **Password Protection:** Encrypt and decrypt images using a user-defined password for an added layer of security.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our intuitive web interface makes the encryption and decryption process a breeze.
- **Versatile Output Options:** Save the encrypted image data as a downloadable text file or copy it to your clipboard for your convenience.
- **Anytime Decryption:** Decrypt your images whenever the need arises.

## Getting Started

To get started with ImageCrypt, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the latest release from our [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/imagecrypt/releases) page.
2. Set up the project by running `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Start the web application using `npm start`.
4. Access the application through your web browser, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How It Works

<a href="https://image-crypt.netlify.app/">ImgCrypt</a> makes use of powerful encryption techniques to secure your image files. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Encryption:**
   - Upload an image file to the web application.
   - Enter a strong password for encryption.
   - Click the "Encrypt" button.
   - ImageCrypt will generate an encrypted string.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Visit the ImageCrypt website.
   - Click on the "Decrypt" link.
   - Enter the encrypted string and the corresponding password.
   - The original image will be displayed and can be downloaded.

Remember to store your password securely. Without the correct password, decryption is not possible, ensuring the security of your data.
